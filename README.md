VTALocationIcon
===============

An iOS 7 location icon drawn in code and Storyboard-ready. Takes its colour from the tint property, so it'll fit right in with your iOS 7 designs.

Simply draw out a square view and it'll do the rest.

Animates into a circle because CODING CHALLENGE. Probably don't use that.

(Or fork it and make it animate into something more useful.)
